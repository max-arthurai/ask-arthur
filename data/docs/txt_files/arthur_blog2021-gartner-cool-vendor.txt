The more ubiquitous AI becomes, the more AI practitioners recognize in their everyday work that data and algorithms amplify and perpetuate human biases.”According to the same report, Gartner predicts that “Through 2025, 80% of organizations seeking to scale digital business will fail because they do not take a modern approach to data and analytics governance.”Through 2025, 80% of organizations seeking to scale digital business will fail because they do not take a modern approach to data and analytics governance.
