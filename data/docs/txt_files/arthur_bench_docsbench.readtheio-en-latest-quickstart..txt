 Quickstart - bench documentation
Quickstart#
Make sure you have completed installation from the setup guide before moving on to this quickstart.
Environment setup#
The environment variable BENCH_FILE_DIR points to the local directory where your test data is saved and visualized by Arthur Bench.
If you are running this quickstart right after completing the setup guide, then take a moment to reset BENCH_FILE_DIR to its default value, "./bench_runs". This will direct the bench UI to point to your new quickstart test suite instead of the examples from the setup.
export BENCH_FILE_DIR="./bench_runs"
Creating your first test suite#
Instantiate a test suite with a name, data, and scorer.
This example creates a test suite from lists of strings directly with the exact_match scorer.
from arthur_bench.run.testsuite import TestSuite
suite = TestSuite(
'bench_quickstart',
'exact_match',
input_text_list=["What year was FDR elected?", "What is the opposite of down?"],
reference_output_list=["1932", "up"]
)
You can create test suites from a pandas DataFrame or from a path to a local CSV file. See the test suite creation guide to view all the ways you can create test suites.
You can view all scorers available out of the box with bench here on our scoring page, as well as customize your own.
Running your first test suite#
To create a Test Run, you only need to specify the candidate responses. See the test suite creation guide to view all the ways you can run test suites.
run = suite.run('quickstart_run', candidate_output_list=["1932", "up is the opposite of down"])
print(run)
>>> [TestCaseOutput(output='1932', score=1.0), TestCaseOutput(output='up is the opposite of down', score=0.0)]
You should now have logged test case results with scores of 1.0 and 0.0, respectively.
View results in local UI#
Now run bench from the command line to launch the local UI and explore the test results.

Next steps#
Now that you have set up and ran your first test suite, check out the rest of the scorers available in Arthur Bench out of the box.
