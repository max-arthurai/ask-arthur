 LLM
The Control Plane for LLMsEverything you need to quickly and safely deploy LLMs into mission-critical applications.Arthur is the all-in-one solution for deploying and running LLMs, trusted by the most important companies in the world with mission-critical applications. From evaluation and validation to firewall protection and monitoring, we’ve developed a state-of-the-art LLM product suite that makes generative AI simple, useful, and safe.FirewallEvaluationObservabilityChatCompanies across industries are rapidly integrating large language models into their operations, but they don’t have a way to ensure deployment that’s both fast and safe.Arthur Shield, the world’s first firewall for LLMs, protects organizations against the most serious risks and safety issues with LLMs in production.Mitigate risks like:PII or sensitive data leakageHallucinationsToxic, offensive, or problematic language generationPrompt injectionsLearn MoreAs the LLM landscape rapidly evolves, it’s crucial for companies to keep abreast of advancements and continually ensure their LLM choice remains the best fit for the organization’s specific needs.With Arthur Bench, our open source evaluation product, companies can make informed, data-driven decisions by comparing different LLM options.Bench helps businesses with:Model selection & validationBudget & privacy optimizationTranslation of academic benchmarks to real-world performanceLearn MoreArthur helps enterprise teams optimize model operations and performance at scale. Our platform tracks and improves key metrics for not only your LLMs in production, but for tabular, CV, and NLP models as well.With Arthur Scope, you can:Detect model and data issues immediatelySurface actionable insights to improve performanceOptimize model portfolio managementReduce risk with comprehensive ML governanceLearn MoreLLM applications are hard to build—they require resources, knowledge, and time for your team to ramp up on new concepts. Arthur Chat is a highly configurable, plug-and-play, LLM-powered chat experience that allows you to focus more on delivering value, rather than delivering code.Chat provides organizations with:A completely turnkey chat experience, ready to deploy
