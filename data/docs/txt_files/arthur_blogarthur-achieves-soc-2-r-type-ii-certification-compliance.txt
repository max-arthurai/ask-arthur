Company UpdatesArthur Achieves SOC 2® Type II Certification & ComplianceBy:Arthur TeamJanuary 18, 2023Today, we’re excited to announce that Arthur has completed our Systems and Organization Controls (SOC 2®) Type II certification. SOC 2 has long been regarded as the gold standard for SaaS security compliance and is a critical enterprise milestone in upholding the trust service principles of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). As a model monitoring company, security is important to everything we do at Arthur. Our platform is constantly measuring, processing, and analyzing machine learning models to deliver better results for our customers—and working with customers in highly regulated industries only heightens the importance of security compliance. Arthur’s successful completion of both SOC 2 Type I and Type II audits in 2022 means that our company has consistently maintained infrastructure service processes that meet the required levels of oversight and monitoring so that we can proactively identify and address any unusual activity. Additionally, it demonstrates our commitment to meeting the industry’s most rigorous data security, availability, and confidentiality standards. “From day one, Arthur’s focus has been to develop a robust model monitoring solution that adheres to best-in-class security and data privacy controls, in order to deliver a trustworthy experience for our enterprise customers,” said Arthur’s VP of Engineering George Chitouras.As we continue to scale solutions in financial services, healthcare, insurance and more, worldwide trust in our infrastructure, software, people, data, and procedures is paramount for scaling model ops in the cloud. ‍Want to learn more about our commitment to security?
