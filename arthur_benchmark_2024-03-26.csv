2. **Custom Scorers**: The Bench documentation mentions that users can create their own custom scorers. This could allow you to develop more sophisticated scoring mechanisms tailored to evaluating LLM performance on coding tasks, such as checking for correct syntax, logical structure, or adherence to best practices.

13,What is the difference between Bench test suites and test runs?,A test suite stores the input & reference output data for your testing use case along with a scorer. A test run evaluates the candidate outputs provided in the run and assigns a score to each test case.,"Test suites in Bench are used to define the data and parameters for testing, while test runs actually execute the tests using the specified test suite configurations.","Test suites in Bench are the main touch point for creating and running tests, while test runs are the actual execution of those tests within a suite. Test suites define the data and parameters for the tests, while test runs execute those tests with specific inputs and outputs.","Test Suites store input & reference output data with a scorer, while Test Runs evaluate candidate outputs against the Test Suite's criteria and assign scores to each test case.","Test suites in Bench are the main touch point for creating and running tests, while test runs are the actual execution of those tests within the test suite.

1. Test Suites: A test suite is a collection of test cases that are designed to evaluate the performance and behavior of an AI model or application. It defines the input data, reference outputs, and the scoring metrics to be used.

2. Test Runs: A test run is the execution of a test suite against a specific candidate model or application. It generates the candidate outputs and compares them to the reference outputs using the specified scoring metrics.

In summary, a test suite defines the test cases and evaluation criteria, while a test run executes the test suite against a candidate model and produces the performance results. You can create multiple test runs for a single test suite to compare the performance of different models or configurations.","The key difference between Bench test suites and test runs is:

1. Test Suites: A test suite is the overall collection of test cases that you want to evaluate your AI model or application against. It defines the input data, reference outputs, and scoring metrics to be used.

2. Test Runs: A test run is the execution of a test suite against a specific candidate model or application. When you run a test suite, you provide the candidate outputs that you want to evaluate, and the test run will score those outputs against the reference data defined in the test suite.

In summary, the test suite defines the overall test framework, while the test run executes that framework against a specific candidate to generate performance metrics and results.
