Admin Console
The Admin Console can be made available via the ingress controller on port 443 by creating a subdomain DNS record that starts with admin. (e.g., admin.arthur.mydomain.com). This eliminates the port 8800 egress requirement for VM installation on the firewall.
We recommend that you rotate your Admin Console password often. You can reset the password using this command:
Shellkubectl kots reset-password -n <namespace>

Password for user postgres: <type_current_secret>
psql (11.13)
