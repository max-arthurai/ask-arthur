Creating an API Key
To access the Arthur platform outside of Arthur, you specify your access rights. One way to do that is through an API key. To get an API key from Arthur, users need to go into the Settings of their Organizational dashboard. From there, they need to click on the API Keys Tab and click the Create API Key button.
ðŸ“˜API Key == Header in API ExamplesWhen using the API example structure in this documentation, you should place your API key in the header section of the call you are trying to build.
Connecting to a Specific Arthur Model within the SDK
After connecting to your Arthur instance, whether you are using the API or Arthur Python SDK, it is common for teams to want to connect to a specific Arthur model. There are two ways to identify a specific model within Arthur, shown below:
Partner Model ID: The Partner Model ID is an ID given to the model by the customer team/user that onboarded the model. This can be found in the UI under the Details section of your model.
Arthur Model ID: The Arthur Model ID is a unique ID given to the model by the Arthur platform. This can be found in your Arthur instance in the URL of your model.
Connecting to the Python SDK
The Arthur Python SDK, discussed in more detail here, is one of the most common ways teams interact with the Arthur platform in a notebook environment.
Connect to Platform
When connecting to the Arthur platform with the SDK, there are two
API KeyUsername Passwordimport arthurai as ArthurAI
arthur = ArthurAI(url="https://app.arthur.ai",
login="<YOUR_USERNAME_OR_EMAIL>",
password = "<YOUR_PASSWORD>")
import arthurai as ArthurAI
arthur = ArthurAI(url="YOUR_ORGANIZAIONS_ARTHUR_URL",
login="username", password = "password")
Specifying Organization ID
If you log in with your Username and Password and are a member of multiple organizations within Arthur, you must specify which organization you want to connect to within the notebook. This can be done by adding the organization_id to your connection.
Pythonimport arthurai as ArthurAI
connection = ArthurAI(url="YOUR_ORGANIZAIONS_ARTHUR_URL",
login="username", password = "password", organization_id = "org_id")
You should contact your system administrator if you are unsure what your organization ID is. You can also see a list of all possible organization IDs you have access to in a notebook by running this Python script:
Pythonconnection = ArthurAI(url="YOUR_ORGANIZAIONS_ARTHUR_URL",
login="username", password = "password", verify_ssl=False)
import requests
headers = {
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
'Authorization': connection.client.session.headers['Authorization']
}
session = requests.Session()
response = session.get("https://<YOUR_ORGANIZATIONS_URL>/api/v3/organizations?page_size=1000000", headers = headers,verify=False)
print(response.json())
Connect to Specific Arthur Model
Either of these can be used to connect to Arthur with this code:
Python## Using Partner Model ID
arthur_model = connection.get_model(place_partner_id, id_type="partner_model_id")
## Using Arthur Model ID
arthur_model = connection.get_model(place_model_id, id_type="id")
Connecting to the API
To connect to the API, users have the same permissions as above.
