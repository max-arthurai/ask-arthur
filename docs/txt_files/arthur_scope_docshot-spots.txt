 Hot Spots
Hot SpotsAutomatically illuminate underperforming segments in your dataSuggest EditsWhen a system has high-dimensional data, finding the right data input regions, such as troubleshooting, becomes a difficult problem. Hotspots automate identifying regions associated with poor ML performance to significantly reduce the time and error of finding such regions. Arthur Scope utilizes a proprietary tree-based algorithm to search out areas of underperformance and explain them through human-understandable language. Find out more about the algorithm here:
Hot Spots in Arthur Scope
Hot Spots are under the Insights tab in your Arthur Model dashboard.
Time Intervals: To highlight when underperformance occurred, Hot Spots are calculated for specific segments of time. For batch models, this is every batch. For streaming models, this is every 7 days.
Performance Threshold: In the UI, Hot Spots we currently only have accuracy Hot Spots available to detect performance under 40%.
Subgroups: The segments of data that have been identified as underperforming in each Hot Spot
Clicking on a Hot Spot
Subgroup Performance: The accuracy rate for this subgroup of data
Inference Count: How many inferences were included in this subgroup
Subgroup Rules: The rules that define the inferences included in this subgroup. Rules are set up to incorporate any metadata sent to Arthur, not just model features (i.e., can include any non-input attributes provided to Arthur). To ensure actionable Hot Spots, we allow a maximum of 7 rules.
View Inferences Button: Click on this button to go to the inferences deep dive page automatically filtered to match the rules within this subgroup for continued exploration
Status Button: Change the status from New to Acknowledged to alert other team members that you have evaluated this hot spot.
